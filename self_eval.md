# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
Whenever you need to seperate out two or more inputs to seperate outputs. Using evaluation of true and false statements allows for different inputs to be handled differently and provide unique outputs.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I was unable to figure out challenge 3, I'm not really sure how to figure this one out. I did exensive googling but I suppose I would try a different avenue.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
The problem solving on challenge 2 was pretty fun. I think I learned a lot trying challenge 3 also which was quite fun. I'm just not sure if I have the knowledge base to get this one yet unfortunately.
